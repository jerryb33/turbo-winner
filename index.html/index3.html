    <h2>Introduction to Myself</h2>

      My name is Jeremiah K. Browne

      <p>I am a Nigerian and a student of AltSchool Africa.</p>

        &nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, as earlier stated, my name is Jeremiah Browne. I'm from
        Nigeria and that's where I currently live as well, and I am also a
        student of Altschool Africa. I am also a total newbie towards everything
        about coding and software engineering, but I plan to change that here in
        and through AltSchoolAfrica. But first of all, let me tell you how it
        all started.
      </p>

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; My passion for coding all started a few years ago when my
        family and I made a casual stop at an eatery, and a web-developer
        working at an adjacent table to ours caught my attention. I saw the guy
        (unknown developer) typing in some CSS codes on his computer, and then
        having them 'magically' transformed into designs that appeared in his
        browser. I was amazed when I saw how he 'magically' turned texts into
        designs and I became awestruck at his 'abilities' to do the 'magic' I
        was seeing him perform on his screen. And since then, I started to
        nurture a faint sense of curiosity, and a tinge of interest (that after
        a lot of research, gradually grew with time) towards coding and
        everything computer related.
      </p>

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; A year after the encounter with the 'mysterious developer',
        I had completely fell in love with the idea of coding and that love was
        the foundation on which i built my goal to become a professional
        software engineer. And despite knowing the time and effort I'll have to
        sacrifice in order to become one, I have decided that I will forge a
        path for myself, break through all barriers that will or may try to stop
        me, and charge ahead into my dream. I'll break past Front-end, Back-end
        and finally, Cloud Engineeering to become a Principal Engineer.
      </p>

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Although I am new to coding, web-developing/designing and
        all, and my dreams, visions, goals etc. may seem far-fetched and a
        little too over-the-top (presently), I know that through AltSchool
        Africa, perseverance, and some frantic and determined practice, this
        seemingly impossible and difficult journey will be made possible.
